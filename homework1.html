        <p> My name is Rhoel Villarin. I grow up on an island surrounded by water west of the pacific. I have been in the United States for about eighteen years and leave most of my years in Northern California. The first city that I stayed in was Stockton, and then I move to Hayward, where I was recruited to join the US Army. While on my active duty service, I was stationed at Fort Bliss, El Paso, Texas, and stayed there until I separated from my active service. I came back to Bay Area and joined the Signal Corps Battalion to continue my military service as a reserve soldier. As of this date, I am currently enrolled at CCSF, taking up special courses to enhance my skills in Information Technology.</p>
  
                
        <p> As I started this course, CNIT 132, I realized that the web development course is interesting to track, and with the advanced subjects available to reinforce the knowledge, I think I will be a good web designer in the future working as a front-end developer. As I start digging information regarding web development, I came across this website that boost my interest in spending more time developing my front-end skills. If you're interested in web development and may want to consider a career as a front-end developer. This <a href="https://www.careerexplorer.com/careers/front-end-developer/" target="_blank"> website </a> can open the Pandora box for you to learn the specifics of a future web developer. </p>
